# ◌ْ Sukūn – The Silent Letter

The **Sukūn (◌ْ)** is a small circle placed **above a letter** to indicate that the letter is **not followed by a vowel** — it is **silent** or **rests**.

---

## 🧠 What Does Sukūn Do?

- It **removes the vowel** from a consonant.
- The letter is pronounced **with no following sound** (no "a", "i", or "u").
- It often follows a **voweled letter**, forming a closed syllable.

# 📘 Tajweed Basics — Part 5: Simple Word Reading

Now that you've learned the Arabic letters (Huruf), Harakāt (vowels), and basic Tajweed marks like **Sukūn**, **Shadda**, and **Tanwīn**, it's time to **start reading simple words** in Arabic — the way they appear in the Qur'an.

## 🔤 1️⃣ 3-Letter Words with Short Vowels

These words use **Fatha (◌َ), Kasra (◌ِ), and Damma (◌ُ)**.

| Arabic | Transliteration | Meaning       |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------- |
| كَتَبَ | kataba          | He wrote      |
| فَهِمَ | fahima          | He understood |
| خَرَجَ | kharaja         | He went out   |

> 📌 Practice reading each letter **with its vowel**, and say it clearly.

## 🛑 2️⃣ Words with Sukūn (◌ْ)

Sukūn means the letter has **no vowel** — just a stop or pause.

| Arabic   | Transliteration | Sound Focus   |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| أَكْبَرُ | akbaru          | كْ = “k” only |
| يَذْهَبُ | yadhhabu        | ذْ = “dh”     |
| نَسْجُدُ | nasjudu         | سْ = “s”      |

> 🧠 Say the consonant **sharply without any vowel** after the Sukūn.

## 🔁 3️⃣ Words with Shadda (◌ّ)

Shadda doubles the letter — say it **with emphasis**.

| Arabic   | Transliteration | Focus     |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- |
| رَبِّكَ  | rabbika         | بّ = “bb” |
| أُمَّةٌ  | ummatun         | مّ = “mm” |
| إِنَّنِي | innani          | نّ = “nn” |

> ✨ Think of Shadda as **pressing the letter twice**.

---

## 🌀 4️⃣ Words with Tanwīn (◌ً ◌ٍ ◌ٌ)

These endings add an **“n” sound** to make a word indefinite.

| Arabic   | Transliteration | Type      |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- |
| كِتَابٌ  | kitābun         | Dammatayn |
| طَعَامًا | taʿāman         | Fathatayn |
| مَسْجِدٍ | masjidin        | Kasratayn |

> 📚 Tanwīn is **very common in Qur’anic Arabic**, especially at the end of nouns.

## 🧠 Practice Reading Sentences (Beginner)

Start reading short phrases and ayahs (verses) from the Qur'an. Here are some examples:

### 🔸 بِسْمِ اللَّهِ

- **bismi-llāhi** — _In the name of Allah_

### 🔸 إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ

- **inna-llāha ghafūrun raḥīm** — _Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful_

> ✅ Read **slowly**, **clearly**, and **respectfully**.

- 🎧 Use audio reciters (like Mishary Alafasy or Husary)

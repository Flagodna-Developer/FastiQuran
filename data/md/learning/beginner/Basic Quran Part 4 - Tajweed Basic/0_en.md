## 🧩 The 5 Pillars of Tajweed Basics

### 1️⃣ **Makharij al-Huruf** — Letter Articulation Points

Every Arabic letter is produced from a **specific place in the mouth or throat**. Learning these helps in **clear pronunciation**.

| Letter | Makhraj Location         |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| ق      | Deep throat (Aqsal Halq) |
| ب      | Lips (Ash-Shafatain)     |
| ل      | Tongue (Al-Lisan)        |

---

### 2️⃣ **Sifat al-Huruf** — Letter Characteristics

These are the **qualities** of each letter (like being soft, strong, whispered, etc.). For example:

| Characteristic | Arabic | Meaning              |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| Shiddah        | شدة    | Strength             |
| Hams           | همس    | Whispering           |
| Qalqalah       | قلقلة  | Echo/vibration sound |

### 3️⃣ **Rules of Noon Sakinah & Tanween** (نْ / ◌ً ◌ٍ ◌ٌ)

When Noon (نْ) or Tanween appears, there are 4 possible Tajweed rules:

- **Iẓhār** – Clear pronunciation
- **Iqlāb** – Change Noon to Meem sound
- **Idghām** – Merge with next letter
- **Ikhfāʼ** – Hide or blend the sound

---

### 4️⃣ **Rules of Meem Sakinah (مْ)**

When **Meem has a Sukūn**, we must follow these 3 rules:

- **Idghām Shafawi** – Merge with another Meem
- **Ikhfāʼ Shafawi** – Blend with Baa (ب)
- **Iẓhār Shafawi** – Clear Meem sound

---

### 5️⃣ **Madd (Prolongation)**

These are rules that **extend the sound** of a letter, especially with Alif (ا), Waw (و), or Yaa (ي) when they are long vowels.

| Madd Type     | Length     |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Madd Tabee’i  | 2 counts   |
| Madd Munfasil | 4–5 counts |
| Madd Mutasil  | 4–6 counts |

## 🧠 BONUS: Common Symbols in Mushaf (Qur'an)

| Symbol   | Name        | Purpose                      |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| ◌ْ       | Sukūn       | No vowel sound (silent stop) |
| ◌ّ       | Shadda      | Double or stress the letter  |
| ◌ً ◌ٍ ◌ٌ | Tanwīn      | "an", "in", or "un" sound    |
| ۝        | Waqf Lazim  | Mandatory stop               |
| ﴿ ﴾      | Verse Marks | Start/end of verse (ayah)    |

# 🧠 Part 4: Why Focus Is Important in Salah

Salah is not just movement — it is a **spiritual connection** with Allah ﷻ.  
That’s why **focus (khushu')** is one of the most important parts of prayer.

---

## 🕋 What is Khushu‘?

**Khushu‘ (خشوع)** means:

- A heart that is **humbled** and **present**.
- A mind that is **not distracted**.
- A body that moves with **calmness and meaning**.

> 🤲 **True Salah** is when your **heart**, **mind**, and **body** all come together.

## ❓ Why is Focus So Important?

### 1️⃣ Allah is Watching You

- When you say “**Allahu Akbar**”, you are standing before **The King of all kings**.
- Imagine if you met a president — would you look at your phone?

---

### 2️⃣ Focus Brings Peace

- Allah says:

  > _“Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.”_  
  > — **[Qur’an 13:28]**

- Focus helps you feel **calm**, **safe**, and **close to Allah**.

---

### 3️⃣ Lack of Focus Reduces Rewards

- Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:
  > _A person may pray and only get **1/10**, **1/5**, or **1/3** of the reward..._  
  > _(Based on how focused they were)_ — [Abu Dawood]

---

### 4️⃣ Shaytan Tries to Distract You

- Shaytan whispers when you pray.
- He makes you think of:
  - What to eat
  - Your phone
  - Random thoughts
- Stay alert and say: **A‘ūdhu billāhi min ash-shayṭānir-rajīm** (I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil).

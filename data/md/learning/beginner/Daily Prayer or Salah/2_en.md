## 🌟 Sunnah Salah (Voluntary, Recommended Prayers)

These are **extra prayers** that the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ regularly prayed.  
They bring **great rewards** and complete any gaps in our obligatory prayers.

| Prayer  | Sunnah Before | Sunnah After | Witr (Night)         |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Fajr    | 2 rak‘ah      | —            | —                    |
| Dhuhr   | 2 or 4 rak‘ah | 2 rak‘ah     | —                    |
| Asr     | 4 rak‘ah\*    | —            | —                    |
| Maghrib | —             | 2 rak‘ah     | —                    |
| Isha    | —             | 2 rak‘ah     | 1, 3, or more rak‘ah |

> 💡 _The 4 Sunnah before Asr are **optional**, but recommended by many scholars._

> 🌙 **Witr** is highly recommended after Isha — it’s the **final prayer of the night**.

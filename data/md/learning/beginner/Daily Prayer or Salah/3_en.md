# ❗ Part 3: Easy Mistakes to Avoid in Prayer (Salah)

Even when we try our best, some **common mistakes** can happen during prayer — especially for beginners.  
Let’s learn how to **avoid them** so our Salah becomes better and more accepted by Allah ﷻ.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes in Salah

### 1️⃣ Not Facing the Qiblah (Direction of Ka‘bah)

- Always face the **Ka‘bah in Makkah** when praying.
- If unsure, use a **Qiblah app** or **ask someone** nearby.

---

### 2️⃣ Praying Without Wudhu (Ablution)

- **Wudhu is required** before every prayer.
- Learn what **breaks wudhu** (e.g. using the toilet, deep sleep).
- Make sure to **wash properly** — don’t rush.

---

### 3️⃣ Missing Takbir al-Ihram (First “Allahu Akbar”)

- Saying **“Allahu Akbar”** at the beginning starts the prayer.
- Without it, the prayer doesn’t count.

---

### 4️⃣ Rushing Through Movements

- Each part (Ruku‘, Sujood, etc.) should be done **calmly**.
- Pause **briefly** in each position.
  > 🧘 _Prayer is not exercise — it's a connection with Allah._

---

### 5️⃣ Not Saying the Words Clearly

- Say **the words of prayer clearly and slowly**.
- Try to **memorize and understand** what you're saying.
- If reading from a card, **pause** to look if needed.

---

### 6️⃣ Looking Around or Being Distracted

- Look at the **place of sujood (prostration)**.
- Don’t check your phone, the clock, or surroundings.
- Focus your **heart and body** on the prayer.

---

### 7️⃣ Skipping Required Parts

- Don’t skip:
  - **Sujood twice** per rak‘ah
  - **Tashahhud** in the middle and end
  - **Salam** at the end of Salah

---

### 8️⃣ Not Covering Awrah (Private Areas)

- Men: From **navel to knees** must be covered.
- Women: **Whole body except face and hands** should be covered.
- Clothes must be **clean**, **not see-through**, and **not tight**.

---

### 9️⃣ Praying Too Late

- Each prayer has a **fixed time** — don’t delay until it's almost over.
- Better to pray **early in the time window**.

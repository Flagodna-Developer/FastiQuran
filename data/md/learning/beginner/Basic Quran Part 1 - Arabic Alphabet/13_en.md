# 📘 Lesson 13: Shīn (ش)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Shīn
- **Arabic Letter:** ش
- **Alphabet Position:** 13/28
- **Articulation Point:** Middle of the tongue near the roof of the mouth
- **Type:** Voiceless, whistling/hushing sound

## Pronunciation

- Similar to the English **"sh"** in _shoe_ or _shining_
- **Air flows** between the tongue and the roof of the mouth
- No vibration in the throat — **a whispering, sharp sound**

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Sīn (س)** – "s" sound, not "sh"
- **Jīm (ج)** – "j" sound, not hushing
- **Ṣād (ص)** – heavier, non-whistling “s”

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------- |
| شَمْسٌ      | shams-un      | Sun     |
| شَجَرَةٌ    | shajarah      | Tree    |
| شَيْءٌ      | shay’-un      | Thing   |
| مَشْهُورٌ   | mashhūr-un    | Famous  |

## Tips

- Raise the **middle of the tongue** close to the roof of the mouth
- Let the **air hiss out** like "shhh"
- Be soft but clear — no buzzing or heavy push

---

## Spiritual Reminder

> **ش** is used in words like **شَمْس** (sun), which Allah swears by in the Qur’an (Surah Ash-Shams).  
> Reading just **one ش = 10 good deeds**. Words like **شَيْءٌ** multiply rewards with each sound.

---

## Practice

Say each word carefully:

- **شَمْسٌ**
- **شَجَرَةٌ**
- **شَيْءٌ**
- **مَشْهُورٌ**

🗣 Whisper clearly, like _"shhh"_, with a soft airflow from your mouth.

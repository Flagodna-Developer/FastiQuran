# 📘 Lesson 4: Thā’ (ث)

## 🔤 Name: **Thā’**

**Arabic Letter:** ث  
**Position in Alphabet:** 4th out of 28  
**Makharij (Articulation Point):** Tip of the tongue **lightly touches** the **edges of the upper front teeth** — similar to the English "th" in _think_

---

## 🔊 Pronunciation

**Thā’** sounds like the soft English **"th"** (as in _three_), not like **"s"**, **"z"**, or **"t"**.

### Key Characteristics:

- Soft, clear **"th"** sound
- Tongue **must come out slightly**
- Avoid heavy or buzzing sound (that’s for **Zā’ (ظ)**)

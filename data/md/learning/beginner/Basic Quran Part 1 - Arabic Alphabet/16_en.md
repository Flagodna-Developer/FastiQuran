# 📘 Lesson 16: Ṭā (ط)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Ṭā
- **Arabic Letter:** ط
- **Alphabet Position:** 16/28
- **Articulation Point:** Tip of the tongue touching the upper gums (behind the front teeth)
- **Type:** Heavy (Tafkhīm), unvoiced

## Pronunciation

- Heavy or emphatic version of the English **"t"**

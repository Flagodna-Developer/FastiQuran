# 📘 Lesson 10: Rā’ (ر)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Rā’
- **Arabic Letter:** ر
- **Alphabet Position:** 10/28
- **Articulation Point:** Tip of the tongue touches the gums just behind the top front teeth
- **Type:** Voiced, rolling (flapped) sound

## Pronunciation

- Similar to a **lightly rolled "r"** (like in Spanish or some Scottish accents)
- The **tip of the tongue** flaps against the gums briefly
- Must be **voiced** — vocal cords vibrate during pronunciation
- Can be **light** or **heavy** (depends on surrounding letters)

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Lām (ل)** – softer, no vibration
- **Dāl (د)** – no rolling/flap
- **Zāy (ز)** – z-sound, not flapped

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| رَحْمَةٌ    | raḥmah        | Mercy      |
| رَسُولٌ     | rasūl-un      | Messenger  |
| كَبِيرٌ     | kabīr-un      | Great, Big |
| قُرْآنٌ     | qur’ān-un     | The Qur’an |

---

## Tips

- Use the **tip of the tongue** — don’t roll too long
- Practice tapping the tongue once against the top gums
- Rā’ can be **light or heavy**:
  - **Light:** if preceded/followed by kasrah (i sound)
  - **Heavy:** if preceded/followed by fatḥah (a) or ḍammah (u)

## Spiritual Reminder

> **ر** appears in **"Raḥmah"** (Mercy), **"Rasūl"** (Messenger), and **"Qur’an"** — powerful words.  
> Every correct letter = **10 rewards**, and words like **"Qur’an"** may multiply it even more.

---

## Practice

Say each of these words slowly and clearly:

- **رَحْمَةٌ**
- **رَسُولٌ**
- **كَبِيرٌ**
- **قُرْآنٌ**

🗣 Focus on short, clear **tongue taps** — not a long trill.

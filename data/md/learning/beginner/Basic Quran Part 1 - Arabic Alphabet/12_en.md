# 📘 Lesson 12: Sīn (س)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Sīn
- **Arabic Letter:** س
- **Alphabet Position:** 12/28
- **Articulation Point:** Tip of the tongue close to the upper front teeth
- **Type:** Unvoiced, hissing sound

## Pronunciation

- Similar to English **"s"** in _sun_ or _simple_
- The **tongue does not touch** the teeth — it stays close
- Air flows steadily through a narrow gap — **no vibration**

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Zāy (ز)** – voiced, has buzzing sound
- **Ṣād (ص)** – heavy/emphatic “s” sound
- **Thā’ (ث)** – “th” sound in _think_, tongue touches teeth

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning             |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| سَلاَمٌ     | salām-un      | Peace               |
| سَمَاءٌ     | samā’-un      | Sky, heaven         |
| سُورَةٌ     | sūrah         | Chapter (of Qur’an) |
| نَاسٌ       | nās-un        | People              |

---

## Tips

- Make sure the sound is **clear and hissing**, like _s-s-s_
- Do **not vibrate** your throat — it should feel silent and airy
- Practice with tongue **just behind the top front teeth**, not touching

---

## Spiritual Reminder

> **Sīn** is found in beautiful words like **سَلاَم** (peace) and **سُورَة** (chapter of Qur’an).  
> Each letter brings **10 rewards** — saying **سَلاَمٌ** = 60+ rewards!

---

## Practice

Say each word with correct pronunciation:

- **سَلاَمٌ**
- **سَمَاءٌ**
- **سُورَةٌ**
- **نَاسٌ**

🗣 Focus on steady airflow and soft hissing sound.

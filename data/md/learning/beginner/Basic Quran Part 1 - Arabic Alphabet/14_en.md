# 📘 Lesson 14: Ṣād (ص)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Ṣād
- **Arabic Letter:** ص
- **Alphabet Position:** 14/28
- **Articulation Point:** Tip and sides of the tongue touching the upper molars
- **Type:** Heavy (Tafkhīm), unvoiced

## Pronunciation

- Similar to **Sīn (س)** but **heavier** and more powerful
- Sound comes from **broad tongue placement** and **deep chest pressure**
- Think of a strong, **emphatic "s"** — like _sssa_ with a full mouth

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Sīn (س)** – light and hissing
- **Dād (ض)** – also heavy, but different articulation point
- **Ṭā (ط)** – heavy but sounds like "t"

---

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning  |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| صَلَاةٌ     | ṣalāh         | Prayer   |
| صَبْرٌ      | ṣabr-un       | Patience |
| صَدَقَةٌ    | ṣadaqah       | Charity  |
| مَصْدَرٌ    | maṣdar        | Source   |

---

## Tips

- Keep the **tongue broad and heavy**
- Push sound from **deep in your throat or chest**
- Practice the “Ṣ” sound in isolation: **ṣ-ṣ-ṣa**

---

## Spiritual Reminder

> Ṣād is found in important worship words like **صَلَاةٌ** (prayer) and **صَبْرٌ** (patience).  
> Every heavy letter like **ص** carries **immense reward** when recited properly.  
> One **Ṣād = 10 good deeds**, and a proper **ṣalāh** may lead to **Paradise**.

---

## Practice

Say these words slowly:

- **صَلَاةٌ**
- **صَبْرٌ**
- **صَدَقَةٌ**
- **مَصْدَرٌ**

🗣 Emphasize the **heavy "ṣ"**. Fill your mouth — but keep it clear and crisp.

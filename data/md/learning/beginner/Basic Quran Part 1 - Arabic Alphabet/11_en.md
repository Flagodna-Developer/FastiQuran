# 📘 Lesson 11: Zāy (ز)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Zāy
- **Arabic Letter:** ز
- **Alphabet Position:** 11/28
- **Articulation Point:** Tip of the tongue close to the upper front teeth
- **Type:** Voiced, buzzing sound

## Pronunciation

- Similar to the English **"z"** in _zoo_ or _buzz_
- The **tongue does not touch** the teeth — it comes very close
- A **buzzing vibration** should be felt

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Sīn (س)** – unvoiced and hissing like "s"
- **Dhāl (ذ)** – tongue touches teeth and sounds like "th" in _this_
- **Zā’ (ظ)** – heavier, emphatic version of zāy

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| زَيْتٌ      | zayt-un       | Oil          |
| زَهْرَةٌ    | zahrah        | Flower       |
| زَكَاةٌ     | zakāh         | Charity      |
| عَزِيزٌ     | ʿazīz-un      | Mighty, Dear |

---

## Tips

- Focus on creating a **clear, voiced buzzing** sound
- Keep the **tongue close**, but not touching
- Check vibration — you should feel it in your throat and lips

---

## Spiritual Reminder

> Zāy appears in **زَكَاة** (charity), a major act of worship.  
> Every letter gives **10 good deeds** — saying **زَكَاةٌ** gives at least **50 rewards**!

---

## Practice

Recite each word clearly:

- **زَيْتٌ**
- **زَهْرَةٌ**
- **زَكَاةٌ**
- **عَزِيزٌ**

🗣 Repeat 3–5 times. Make the **buzzing z-sound** clear and consistent.

# 📘 Lesson 19: Ghāyn (غ)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Ghāyn
- **Arabic Letter:** غ
- **Alphabet Position:** 19/28
- **Articulation Point:** Upper throat (pharynx)
- **Type:** Voiced, guttural, throaty sound (pharyngeal voiced fricative)

## Pronunciation

- Similar to the letter ʿAyn (ع) but with a nasal, vibrating tone
- Voiced sound produced deep in the throat near the pharynx
- No exact English equivalent; sometimes compared to French **r** in “Paris” but heavier
- Rich, guttural sound with resonance

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **ʿAyn (ع)** – voiced but less nasal, different throat constriction
- **Khā’ (خ)** – unvoiced counterpart, harsher
- Any English letter; Ghāyn is unique

| غُرْفَةٌ    | ghur-fah      | Room           |

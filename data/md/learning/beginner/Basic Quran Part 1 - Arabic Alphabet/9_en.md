# 📘 Lesson 9: Dhāl (ذ)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Dhāl
- **Arabic Letter:** ذ
- **Alphabet Position:** 9/28
- **Articulation Point:** Tip of the tongue touches the edge of the upper front teeth
- **Type:** Voiced, soft and flowing

## Pronunciation

- Similar to English **"th"** in _this_ or _that_ (NOT like "th" in _think_)
- The **tongue must touch** the upper front teeth gently
- Sound is **voiced**, meaning your throat should vibrate

---

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Thā’ (ث)** – unvoiced, lighter "th" like _think_
- **Zāy (ز)** – "z" sound, different articulation
- **Dāl (د)** – "d" sound, no tongue outside

---

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| ذِكْرٌ      | dhikr-un      | Remembrance  |
| ذَهَبَ      | dhahaba       | He went      |
| ذَنْبٌ      | dhanb-un      | Sin          |
| هَذَا       | hādhā         | This (masc.) |

---

## Tips

- Slightly **stick your tongue out** between your teeth — gently
- Say **"this"** and feel how it sounds; replicate that
- Make sure you **voice** the sound (your throat vibrates)

---

## Spiritual Reminder

> Dhāl appears in powerful words like **ذِكْر** (remembrance of Allah).  
> Pronouncing each letter properly gives **10 rewards** — _dhikr_ has \*_4 letters = 40+ rewards instantly._

---

## Practice

Say slowly and clearly:

- **ذِكْرٌ**
- **ذَهَبَ**
- **ذَنْبٌ**
- **هَذَا**

🗣 Practice each word 3–5 times with correct tongue position and vibration.

# 📘 Lesson 7: Khā’ (خ)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** Khā’
- **Arabic Letter:** خ
- **Alphabet Position:** 7/28
- **Articulation Point:** Upper part of the throat (closest to the mouth)
- **Type:** Strong, raspy sound — voiceless but forceful

## Pronunciation

- Similar to a **guttural "kh"** sound — like Scottish _"loch"_ or German _"Bach"_
- Comes from the **top of the throat**, not the chest or mouth
- Not the same as:
  - **Ḥā’ (ح)** – breathy and soft
  - **Ghāf (غ)** – deeper and voiced

## Examples

| Arabic Word | Pronunciation | Meaning  |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| خَيْرٌ      | khayr-un      | Goodness |
| خَوْفٌ      | khawf-un      | Fear     |
| أَخٌ        | akh-un        | Brother  |
| مِفْتَاخٌ   | miftākh-un    | Key      |

## Tips

- Create a **scratchy sound** from your upper throat
- Let air pass strongly but clearly — not blocked
- Practice softly, then gradually with more strength

## Spiritual Reminder

> **Each letter brings 10 good deeds.** Saying **خَيْرٌ** alone gives **50+ rewards**.  
> Khā’ appears in words like **"khayr" (goodness)** — a reminder that learning it brings reward **and** meaning.

## Practice

Say each word clearly and with focus:

- **خَيْرٌ**
- **خَوْفٌ**
- **أَخٌ**
- **مِفْتَاخٌ**

Repeat 3–5 times slowly to develop throat control.

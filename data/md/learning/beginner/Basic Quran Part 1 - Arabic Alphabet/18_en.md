# 📘 Lesson 18: ʿAyn (ع)

## Letter Information

- **Name:** ʿAyn
- **Arabic Letter:** ع
- **Alphabet Position:** 18/28
- **Articulation Point:** Deep in the throat (pharynx)
- **Type:** Voiced, deep throat sound (pharyngeal voiced fricative)

## Pronunciation

- A unique Arabic sound produced by constricting the throat muscles
- No exact English equivalent; a voiced, guttural, throaty sound
- Like a deep voiced grunt or choke — but controlled and clear
- Important for correct Quranic recitation

## Do Not Confuse With:

- **Hamza (ء)** – a glottal stop, not voiced
- **Ghāyn (غ)** – similar but voiced with a nasal tone
- Any English letter; ʿAyn is unique to Semitic languages

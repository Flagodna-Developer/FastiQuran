## 🔊 Pronunciation

Alif is usually **silent** unless it **carries a Hamzah (ء)** or follows a **vowel**.

### Basic Sounds:

- **ا** alone = long vowel **"ā"** (like 'a' in _father_)
- **أ** = Alif with Hamzah = glottal "a" (abrupt start, like _uh-oh_)

### Examples:

| Arabic | Pronunciation | Meaning     |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| آدم    | **Ā-dam**     | Adam (name) |
| أنَا   | **A-na**      | I / Me      |
| أكل    | **A-ka-la**   | He ate      |

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

- **Alif is a long vowel**, not a consonant like English 'A'.
- It cannot take a **sukūn ( ْ )**.
- Alif **never** comes at the end of a word with **shaddah ( ّ )**.

## 🏅 Spiritual Motivation

> The Prophet ﷺ said:
>
> "_Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allah, he will have one reward. That reward will be multiplied by ten. I do not say that 'Alif Lām Mīm' is one letter, but Alif is a letter, Lām is a letter, and Mīm is a letter._"  
> — _Tirmidhi_

So by reciting "**Alif**", you earn **ten good deeds (hasanah)**!

## 🧠 Practice Time

Try reading these:

- أَحَدٌ (Ahadun) – One
- آلُهَةٌ (Ālihah) – gods
- أَكْبَرُ (Akbaru) – greater

Listen carefully and repeat multiple times. Focus on **clarity** and **vowel length**.

# 🕌 Qur'anic Arabic Pronunciation Lessons — Part 2: Harakat (Short Vowels)

Learn how to pronounce Arabic **short vowels** (Harakat) correctly according to Qur'anic recitation rules. These symbols are essential for beginners and help form the **correct sound** of each letter in the Qur’an.

> 📖 **Note**: The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:  
> "_Beautify the Qur’an with your voices._"  
> — _[Hadith - Abu Dawud]_

> 🪶 And also:  
> "_Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allah, he will have one reward. That reward will be multiplied by ten._  
> I do not say that 'Alif Lām Mīm' is one letter, but **Alif** is a letter, **Lām** is a letter, and **Mīm** is a letter."  
> — _[Hadith - Tirmidhi]_

## 🔡 Harakat Table

| Symbol | Name  | Arabic | Sound | Pronunciation Hint  |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- | ------------------- |
| ◌َ     | Fatha | بَ     | **a** | "a" as in **"cat"** |
| ◌ِ     | Kasra | بِ     | **i** | "i" as in **"bit"** |
| ◌ُ     | Damma | بُ     | **u** | "u" as in **"put"** |

These are the **basic building blocks** for reading Arabic syllables such as:

- بَ (ba)
- بِ (bi)
- بُ (bu)

## 🧠 Why Are Harakat Important?

- The same letter **ب** can be pronounced **ba**, **bi**, or **bu** based on the Harakah.
- Without Harakat, beginners would **not know how to pronounce** the letter.
- As you progress, you will learn to read without them — but first, they are essential!

# FastiQuran Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: [01 July 2025]_

FastiQuran ("the App") is designed to be a pure Quran application that respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (spoiler: essentially none) and how we handle it.

## üîç Data Collection

FastiQuran **does not**:

- Collect any personal information.
- Track your reading habits or activity within the app.
- Store, upload, or log any user data to external servers.
- Require any form of registration or login.
- Include any third-party ads or analytics.

### What We _Might_ Access (And Why, if applicable):

_Please review the points below and **REMOVE ANY THAT DO NOT APPLY to your FastiQuran app**. If your app truly accesses nothing beyond its own internal files and doesn't save anything or download content, you can remove this entire sub-section and state "FastiQuran does not collect any data" more broadly._

- **Local Storage Access**

  - **Purpose:** To save user preferences, bookmarks, or notes _locally on your device_ (e.g., last read page, font size settings).
  - **Stored?:** Yes (locally on your device, not transmitted or shared externally).

- **Network Access**

  - **Purpose:** To download new content (e.g., audio recitations, translations, app updates) at your explicit request.
  - **Stored?:** No (data is downloaded and stored locally on your device or used temporarily as needed).

- **App Crash Logs**
  - **Purpose:** To help diagnose and fix bugs (only if you _explicitly opt-in_ to send them to the developer). This data is typically anonymized and does not contain personal information.
  - **Stored?:** Optional (only if user opts-in, and typically anonymized).

## üåê Network & Permissions

- **Internet Access**: FastiQuran _does not require_ an internet connection for its core functionality (reading Quran). If it includes features like downloading new recitations or updates, internet access is only used when you explicitly initiate those actions.
- **Storage Permission**: Only required if the app saves user data (like bookmarks, notes, downloaded recitations) directly to your device's storage. You explicitly grant this permission through your device's operating system.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **Data Locality**: All user preferences, bookmarks, notes, and downloaded content (if any) are stored **only on your device**. No personal data is transmitted to or stored on external servers.
- **No External Communication**: The app does not communicate with any external servers for tracking, analytics, or ads.

## üìä Third-Party Services

FastiQuran uses **zero** third-party services for:

- No analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.).
- No ads or trackers of any kind.
- No social media integrations.
- No external APIs for user data processing.

## üßë‚öñÔ∏è Compliance

- **GDPR/CCPA**: Not applicable, as we do not collect, process, or store any personal data.
- **Children‚Äôs Privacy**: FastiQuran is an educational and religious app, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. The App is intended for a general audience.

## üìù Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this Privacy Policy will be posted here on this page. We encourage you to review it periodically.
